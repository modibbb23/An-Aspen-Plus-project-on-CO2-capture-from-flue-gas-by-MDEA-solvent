# An-Aspen-Plus-project-on-CO2-capture-from-flue-gas-by-MDEA-solvent
Simulated a 100 tonne/hr flue gas stream in Aspen Plus using MDEA solvent with the ELECNRTL property method to design an absorberâ€“stripper system for CO2 capture. The flowsheet was created with solvent circulation, regeneration, and makeup sreams. The sensitivity analysis was carried out for stripper stages and lean solvent rate
